# crappy-fbbot (made for messenger)

This bot was built for the module **fbchat** on python 3.7.4. 
I'm still a noob at coding so feel free to make some pull requests.

# Requirements

This bot uses the following modules:

```
- fbchat
- axju-jokes
- wikipedia
- beautifulsoup4
- googletrans
- mtgsdk
- gtts
```

_I may be missing some idk_

**googletrans will ip ban on large requests so use carefully**
